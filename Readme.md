Dynamicwaveripple is a visual example inspired by the Claudius graphics library. It explores creative generative art to generate dynamic wave patterns.


Inspired by the talk at FunOCaml24 and the fascinating approach Claudius takes to solving visual creativity challenges, this project was created to explore functional patterns in visual designs.
 Inspired by https://github.com/claudiusFX/claudius-examples/tree/main/day2.
